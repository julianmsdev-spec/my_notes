**Autonomous** means that something does not need to be provided constant instructions
**Adaptive** means that it can change its behavior as the environment or problem space changes.

Here are some examples of things that exhibit AI-likeness:
- A system that succeeds at playing many types of complex games
- A cancer tumor detection system
- A system that generates artwork based on little input
- A self-driving car

Douglas Hofstadter said, "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet."

*quantitative data* vs *qualitative data*

The act of constructing meaningful insights to answer questions based on data is creating *information*.
The act of utilizing information with experiences and consciously applying it creates *knowledge*.

An *algorithm* is a set of instructions and rules provided as a specification to accomplish a specific goal.
