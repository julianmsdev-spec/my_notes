- *imperative programming*, where a program is decomposed into explicit computational steps in the form of *statements*. 
- *declarative programming*, where computation is expressed in terms of *what* it should accomplish rather than *how*.
- *functional programming*, which models computation after mathematical functions and avoids mutation.
- *logic programming*, which organizes data into *objects* and computation into *methods* that are associated with those objects.
**type systems**
- *static typing*, which types are inferred directly from a program's source code and checked at compile time.
- *dynamic typing*, where types are tracked and checked at runtime.
